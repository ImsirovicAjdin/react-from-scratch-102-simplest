# About this React app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is [deployed on Netlify]().

## Tasks

1. All the files in the `src` folder have been deleted. You need to add the `index.js` file and the `App.js` file, with the same content as what you had in the simplest-101 app.

Note 1: you should try doing it without reading the contents of the simplest-101 app.

Note 2: you'll probably get stuck and won't be able to complete the task. Try coding it on your own, but the first time you're not making progress for more than 5 minutes, you should consult the simplest-101 app to get unstuck.
